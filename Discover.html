  <p>The definition of a supercar describes an expensive car that’s flashy, fast, luxurious, and prestigious. Think of a supercar as top of the line — the best of the best. While insurers have their definitions for supercars, you can generally expect to pay more for auto insurance if you own a luxury vehicle
    <br>
    <br> 
  A car is considered a supercar based on several factors, such as performance, design, price, and exclusivity. Supercars must be fast, usually with a top speed of over 200 mph, and must have a power-to-weight ratio that exceeds that of other sports cars.
    <br>
    <br>
 Obviously, one of the main benefits of owning a supercar is that you can enjoy speed and performance which cannot be matched by anything else on the road. Driving a supercar is a real thrill and will help you to fall in love with driving, which can bring you a lot of happiness in your life
